### **"A New Year, A New Beginning: Creativity, Collaboration, and Courage"**

Hello, everyone!

Many around the world just celebrated **Lunar New Year**â€”yesterday here in Canada and two days ago in Korea and other parts of Asia. No matter when we celebrate, a new year is always a time for **fresh beginnings and new opportunities**.

Recently, I participated in the **Global Game Jam** in Edmonton, where developers built games in just 48 hours. It reminded me that, like in a new year, **taking the first step is the key to growth**.

In game development and life, we often hesitate, fearing failure. But creativity thrives when we take action. And just as this season is about **community and togetherness**, great things happen when we **collaborate and support one another**.

So as we move forward, letâ€™s embrace **creativity, collaboration, courage, and be vibrant!**

To fresh starts and fearless creativityâ€”**please rise and join me in a toast!**

**"To a bright and inspiring year ahead!"** ðŸ¥‚
