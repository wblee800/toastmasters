## French
A significant portion of English vocabulary comes from French, mainly due to the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Legal, political, military, and culinary terms such as government, parliament, judge, court, army, soldier, beef, and pork are of French origin.
## Latin
Latin has influenced English both directly and indirectly. Many Latin words entered English through French, while others were borrowed during the Renaissance and scientific advancements. Words related to academia, law, medicine, and religion, such as manuscript, profound, equilibrium, and sanctuary, have Latin roots.
## Germanic Languages(Old/Middle English, Old Norse, Dutch)
English originates from the West Germanic language family, particularly Old English, which was influenced by Old Norse due to Viking invasions. Many core vocabulary words, including house, mother, sky, they, and give, stem from these languages. Dutch also contributed words related to trade, navigation, and art, such as yacht, skipper, and landscape.
## Greek
Greek has contributed significantly to English, especially in the fields of science, philosophy, and medicine. Many words were borrowed during the Renaissance or through Latin, such as biology, physics, democracy, philosophy, and theater.
## Other Languages
English has adopted words from a variety of languages due to historical interactions, colonization, and trade. Examples include pajamas (Hindi), tsunami (Japanese), safari (Swahili), siesta (Spanish), and schadenfreude (German).
## Proper 
Proper nouns and place names have also contributed to English vocabulary. Some words derived from names include sandwich (from the Earl of Sandwich), jeans (from Genoa, Italy), and champagne (from the Champagne region in France).
