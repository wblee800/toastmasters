# Pronunciation Rules for Regular Plural Nouns

In English, regular plural nouns are typically formed by adding **"-s"** or **"-es"** to the singular form. The pronunciation of the plural ending **"-s"** depends on the final sound of the singular noun. There are three different ways to pronounce **"-s"**:

## 1. /s/ Sound (After Voiceless Sounds)
If the noun ends in a **voiceless consonant** (**/p/, /t/, /k/, /f/, /θ/**), the plural **"-s"** is pronounced as **/s/**.

### ✅ Examples:
| Singular | Plural | Pronunciation |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| cap | caps | /kæps/ |
| cat | cats | /kæts/ |
| book | books | /bʊks/ |
| cliff | cliffs | /klɪfs/ |
| myth | myths | /mɪθs/ |

### Example Sentences
- I bought **three caps** for my baseball team.
- The **cats** are playing in the backyard.
- He has many **books** on his shelf.
- We climbed the steep **cliffs** near the ocean.
- The museum has a collection of ancient **myths**.

## 2. /z/ Sound (After Voiced Sounds)
If the noun ends in a **voiced sound** (**vowel sounds** and **/b/, /d/, /g/, /v/, /ð/, /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /l/, /r/**), the plural **"-s"** is pronounced as **/z/**.

### ✅ Examples:
| Singular | Plural | Pronunciation |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| dog | dogs | /dɔːgz/ |
| bed | beds | /bɛdz/ |
| bag | bags | /bæɡz/ |
| wave | waves | /weɪvz/ |
| pen | pens | /pɛnz/ |

- The **waves** crashed against the shore.
- There are **pens** and notebooks on the desk.

## 3. /ɪz/ Sound (After Sibilant Sounds)
If the noun ends in a **sibilant sound** (**/s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /tʃ/, /dʒ/, /ks/**), we add **"-es"**, and the plural is pronounced as **/ɪz/**(as a seperate syllable).

### ✅ Examples:
| Singular | Plural | Pronunciation |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| bus | buses | /ˈbʌsɪz/ |
| box | boxes | /ˈbɒksɪz/ |
| church | churches | /ˈtʃɜːrtʃɪz/ |
| dish | dishes | /ˈdɪʃɪz/ |
| garage | garages | /ɡəˈrɑːʒɪz/ |
| prize | prizes | /ˈpraɪzɪz/ |

### Example Sentences
- The city buses **are always crowded in the morning.**
- He stacked the **boxes** in the warehouse.
- There are two **churches** in this small town.
- The restaurant serves delicious **dishes**.
- The old house has many **images** of past generations.

## Q. Does the Third Rule Add an Extra Syllable?
Yes, that's correct! The **/ɪz/** sound **adds an extra syllable** to the word.

- **"cat" → "cats" (/kæts/)** → still **one syllable**  
- **"dog" → "dogs" (/dɔːgz/)** → still **one syllable**  
- **"bus" → "buses" (/ˈbʌsɪz/)** → now **two syllables!**  

This happens because the **/ɪz/** sound is a vowel sound, which naturally increases the number of syllables in the word.
